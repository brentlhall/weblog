A New Keyboard for Christmas
============================
December 30, 2025

Sometimes you just need a keyoard to write on your phone!
When that happens you simply have to keep trying keyboards until you find the one that works as you wish it should.

Thanks to our very own Coy Family, I think I've found the one that will satify my needs!

Thanks Chris, Meghan and your four daughters for this keyboard!
