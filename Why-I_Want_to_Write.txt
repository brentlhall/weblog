Why I Want to Write
===================
February 25, 2023

I started reading when I was very young. My mother helped me learn to read to help me live with the breathing ailment I'd had since birth. I spent many evenings sitting with her at the kitchen table listening to her read and following the words in the book.
*
Evenings were generally hard for me. Humidity tended to rise as evening approached and my breathing got worse.
*
The people, authors, that shared their imagination as words in a book made my world so much better. Reading calmed me and I breathed better.
*
So, in a nut shell, I've always wanted to share my imagination, too. Put my thoughts into words that could make another feel better.
