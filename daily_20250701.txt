It is 13:16 and 87 degrees F here in 78233. The sky is mostly cloudy with a 20% chance of rain.
Gracie made enchiladas to share with John and Hilda for dinner. They make our apartment smell wonderful! 
I walked down to check the mail and walked the stairs to get some exercise. The stairs get my blood pumping pretty good. 
I think I'll make a habit of going up and down the building's stairs.
