Learning to Scroll
==================
August 31, 2025

After looking for something to replace Scroll with out much luck, I've decided to continue using scroll to publish to my GitHub blog.
*
Now I'm trying to build the ability to write using my phone and Simple Text editor. I'm also practicing using Gboard in landscape mode with the split keyboard. I think I 
make far fewer mistakes this way but I'm not very fast.
*
My goal is to write to my blog every day. Doing so will build my ability to type on digital devices and increase my ability to write without a separate keyboard on my phone.
