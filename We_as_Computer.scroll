With all the hype about LLMs marketed as AIs, why do we continue to overlook the obvious?

Douglas Adams has suggested, in one of his works of fiction, that Earth was constructed to be a massive computing device. Not a mechanical or digital computer but a biological computer to answer the question of the meaning of life.
***
Michio Kaku, a well known physicist, has said that the human mind/brain is the most amazing device in the known universe. He states that our mind functions on only twenty watts or less of energy. Enough to light a dim light bulb. Less than the common desktop and a minute amount of energy compared to a super computer. We’ve all heard about the massive amounts of electricity the “AIs” require.

Now, I figure, that on our planet-computer we have in the neighborhood of eight billion humans and each are a core of the computer. Unfortunately, an algorithm to network these cores into a super computer has yet to be written. Perhaps an algorithm is not required.
***
Perhaps, the simplest means of creating a network of our minds is conversation. Simply talking to each other. Unfortunately, most conversation is used to divide us into competing tribes. This has kept a majority of us from communicating.
***
Never before in history has the ability and means to communicate with all others been more feasible. We are now capable of creating a super computing device with the ability to solve most problems. All we need to do is converse and help each other and figure things out.
***
This will only work if the majority converse with each other. Converse to understand. Converse to learn. Unite humankind in conversation and compute the means for all to exist and to create a better life for all.
***
Lets talk about it and share our thoughts with all others we make contact with. Perhaps, like a virus, it will spread around our world and come back to us in similar or new form.
