At 14:22 it's 92 F and partly cloudy in San Antonio, Texas.
Looked like rain earlier in the day but no precipitation so far.
We went to 10 o'clock Mass with Hilda. Then had breakfast at Oblate Restaurant before taking Hilda home.
I checked and tightened the support for a backyard light.
We're watching Cubs at Astros baseball.
