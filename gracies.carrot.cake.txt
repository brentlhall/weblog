Gracie's Carrot Cake
====================
November 8, 2025

Gracie made an excellent carrot cake today! 
*
I think Hilda had asked her if she could make one and, of course, she said yes!
We all enjoyed it at Hilda and John's home after dinner. Gracie and I took a nice chunk of it home and we've been enjoying a piece after dinner with coffee.
*
I'm adding this dessert to the list of great desserts Gracie has been making since she's not working!
*
Thanks Gracie for sharing your talents with us hungry admirers!
Please keep it up!
