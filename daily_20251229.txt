December 29, 2025

A cold day with a little rain. High of 47 degrees and cloudy all day.

The Coy family, Chris,Meghan. Charlie, Annabelle, Madelyn, and Emmerson arrived in San Antonio after driving two days from Blue Springs, MO.

Gracie and I were so happy to have them with us safe and sound!

It's very special to have grandchildren with us on occasion. We had dinner then the girls opened they're Christmas gifts from us.

They enjoyed playing with their new things and we got to play along with them. A most delightful evening with very special people.
