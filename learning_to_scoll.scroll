Now I'm trying to build the ability to write using my phone and Simple Text editor. I'm also practicing using Gboard in landscape mode with the split keyboard. I think I

My goal is to write to my blog every day. Doing so will build my ability to type on digital devices and increase my ability to write without a separate keyboard on my phone.
